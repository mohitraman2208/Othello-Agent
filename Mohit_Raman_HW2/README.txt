This assignment strictly follows examplesv2.
Please Note - 

1. Incorrect I/P is not handled. So the solution expects the I/P file to exactly follow the specification.
2. I/P O/P file should be placed inside the folder 'Mohit_Raman_HW2' as per the grading_perl.pl script provided. I have successfully executed the assignment with the grading script in Aludra.  

Please contact me in case of any unforeseen errors.

Happy Grading!
